/* in function

hello();
function hello(){
    console.log ("hello");

}
in computer while writting code it read/ passes two time, first time it see declaratins and then second time it sees if
anywhere it called or ,nnot.
in function, we can call it before making its code block as Above, it first round it sees the expressions and the second time 
it sees the calling so basically it run it.

in Class function
like normal function in class it won't work.
